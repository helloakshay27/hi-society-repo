A session is one continuous visit that ends after about 30 minutes of no activity.', d: "If one person logs in three separate times, that's three sessions.

If losses regularly outweigh gains, growth is at risk.' },

Each cell reads what percentage of that group came back in week 0, week 1, week 2, and so on.', d: 'Reading left to right shows how well each joining group sticks around. Darker cells mean more people retained. It answers "once people start, do they keep coming back?"' },
  'chart.role': { t: 'Usage by role', f: 'Active people broken down by their role (Admin, Supervisor, Technician, Occupant), each shown as a share within the group.', d: 'Shows which types of user are actually engaging. If a key role such as Technicians is under-represented, adoption may be uneven.' },

Status flags a sudden drop (active users down 25%+), a site to watch, or a healthy site.', d: 'A leaderboard to see which sites are adopting well and which are lagging or dropping and may need attention. There is no per-site endpoint, so each row is its own traffic_session call — the table only loads on the All-sites scope, and rows appear as each call lands.' },

The highlighted step is the single biggest drop — where people most often get stuck.' },

Per-path completion (F-comp) needs a flow_key event property that is not instrumented yet, so it reads as a dash.', d: 'A per-screen scorecard so you can see which specific parts of the module are being used and which are ignored.' },
