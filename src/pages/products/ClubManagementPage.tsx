Closest functional competitor is Shawman (India) but lacks mobile, community, AI, F&B management, recipe costing, channel management, and loyalty. Global leaders (MINDBODY, Glofox) are expensive, US-data-stored, and India-unfit. Zenoti comes closest on F&B and accounting (salon/spa focus) but is not purpose-built for sports clubs and lacks channel management and co-player features.",
