      title: "Proven social proof",
      detail: "5+ years of production deployment with India's top developers (Godrej, Piramal, Runwal, Panchshil). This is social proof that eliminates 'unproven startup' objection in enterprise sales."
    },

      id: "S3",
      title: "Revenue-enabling modules",
      detail: "Developer-side engagement module (referral, loyalty, new project marketing) is a category no competitor occupies. It repositions the product from 'cost' to 'revenue enabler' in the developer's P&L."

      title: "FM operations depth",

    {
      id: "S6",
      title: "Lownd-cost CV & ANPR",
      detail: "Computer vision and ANPR integration at community-level pricing is a significant differentiator — these capabilities are typically priced 3–5x higher in standalone security platforms."

    {
      id: "S7",
      title: "Integrated accounting & billing",
      detail: "Integrated accounting module with GST, ERP export, and direct bank settlement eliminates a separate billing tool. Most competitors require Tally/SAP alongside their platform."

    },
    {
      id: "W3",
      title: "Closed ecosystem perception",
      detail: "No public integration marketplace or API documentation portal. Enterprise buyers and system integrators expect a published connector library. Absence creates perception of a closed, inflexible system."

    {
      id: "W4",
      title: "High-touch sales model",

    },
    {
      id: "W7",
      title: "Developer activation dependency",
      detail: "Dependency on developer clients for resident activation — if a developer deploys the app poorly (low communication, no incentive), resident adoption suffers and product value is undermined."

      title: "Lack of published ROI benchmarks",

      title: "Module-segment mismatch",
      detail: "F&B module and some advanced modules (transport, space management) appear better suited to township/co-living than standard gated communities — unclear if these add confusion in core sales motion."
    },
    {
      id: "W10",
      title: "Outcome execution risk",
      detail: "Referral and loyalty module effectiveness depends on developer adoption quality. If developers don't promote the program to residents, the commercial differentiation does not materialise."
    },
    {
      id: "W11",
      title: "Opaque pricing",
      detail: "Pricing structure not publicly documented — likely requires custom quoting for most deals. This slows mid-market sales and makes digital demand generation harder."
    },
    {
      id: "W12",
      title: "Support & success function",
