Layer 2: India-first design — our CAM billing templates, RERA compliance exports, Hindu/regional language support (roadmap Q2 2026), and PMC partnership ecosystem are not replicable by global competitors.

Our multi-category integration is a structural advantage Facilio cannot copy quickly. Risk 2: Enterprise implementations become bottlenecked on change management and training. Mitigation: We invest in pre-packaged configuration templates for top 5 building archetypes (offices, malls, IT parks, manufacturing, hospitals) to reduce customisation time from 12 weeks to 4 weeks.
