Clients use it for voucher fulfilment but it is NOT a loyalty programme — it has no rule engine, no wallet, no tiers, no escrow.\nHow: Position Xoxoday as the fulfilment layer and us as the intelligence layer. Message: 'Your team already uses Xoxoday for vouchers. We are what sits behind it — the rules engine that decides who gets what, when, and why.' Offer a joint integration story where we power the rules and Xoxoday fulfils the reward. This turns their installed base into our pipeline.",

        question: "What to STOP doing or saying — it is diluting our position",
        answer:
          "STOP: Positioning as a 'loyalty platform' generically — this puts us in the same category as Capillary and Salesforce Loyalty where we cannot win on brand or scale.\nSTOP: Leading with the redemption catalogue — it is a feature, not a position. Competitors also have redemption catalogues.\nSTOP: Talking about 'earning points' — this is table stakes. Lead with the rule engine complexity, the escrow controls, and the CRM integration depth.\nSTART: Leading with the financial risk angle — 'What is your current loyalty liability, and how are you managing it?' This opens the CFO door.",

        answer:
          "MOTION: Direct Sales + Reference-Led Selling\nYear 1 is not a PLG or channel year — the product requires configuration and the deal size justifies direct sales.\nPlaybook:\n1. Use the live reference client as the centrepiece of every sales conversation — offer a site visit / demo with the client's team.\n2. Target CRM-adjacent consultants and Salesforce implementation partners as channel referral sources — they encounter loyalty programme requirements in every client engagement.\n3. Attend 2–3 vertical-specific events per quarter (real estate: CREDAI, NAREDCO; BFSI: FIBAC; auto: SIAM)\n4. Produce one vertical-specific ROI case study per quarter — translate product features into ₹ impact (collections TAT improvement, referral cost reduction, etc.)",

            "What problem are you solving, for whom, and why does it need solving now?",
          answer:
            "I am solving the complete absence of configurable, financially controlled loyalty programme infrastructure for businesses in high-value, low-frequency purchase industries - specifically real estate developers, banks and NBFCs, and automotive dealer groups.\n\nThe problem has three layers:\n\nFirst, these companies have no automated way to reward customers for behaviours that directly improve their business metrics - paying a demand note early, referring a buyer, returning for an aftersales service visit, or completing digital onboarding. They manage referral programmes on Excel, pay incentives manually weeks after the event, and have no rule engine that can translate a business condition (paid within 5 days of demand note) into an automated reward.\n\nSecond, the loyalty platforms that exist - Capillary, Salesforce Loyalty Management, Antavo - are built for retail. They have no understanding of a demand note, no concept of a possession TAT incentive, no escrow wallet for loyalty liability management. A real estate developer trying to use Capillary is fitting a round peg into a square hole, and paying Rs1Cr+ per year for the privilege.\n\nThird, there is a genuine financial control gap. Every loyalty programme creates a liability - unredeemed points are a balance-sheet obligation. No loyalty SaaS in the market offers a structured escrow wallet with a mandatory float and mark-to-market balance. CFOs at our target clients are either blocking loyalty programmes because of unquantified liability risk, or running them with no financial visibility at all.",

          question: "What is your solution, and how does it work?",
          answer:
            "We are a B2B SaaS loyalty rule engine - the intelligence layer that sits between a company's CRM and their customers, turning every meaningful customer behaviour into an automated, personalised reward.\n\nHere is how it works:\n\nA business configures their loyalty programme through our no-code admin interface. They define tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold), earning rules (pay demand note within 5 days = 6,000 points), and redemption options (encash points against outstanding dues, redeem for travel, merchandise, or experiences). Rules span 7 dimensions: user actions, transaction events, time-based events, customer segments, engagement behaviour, milestones, and tier-based conditions.\n\nWhen a customer does something that meets a rule's conditions - Salesforce sends us the event via API, we evaluate the rule in real time, credit the customer's wallet, and notify them via push notification. The entire loop - behaviour to reward - happens in seconds, not weeks.\n\nThe money sits in a structured escrow wallet: 25% of total outstanding loyalty liability is maintained as a float, mark-to-market. The CFO can see the exact liability exposure at any time.\n\nWhen customers want to redeem, they open the personalised mobile redemption page - which shows only the rewards they can afford and are most likely to want. They can redeem for vouchers, experiences, travel, merchandise, lounge access, or cash (direct bank transfer). Points that are not yet redeemable sit in a cold wallet - controlling redemption velocity and protecting cash flow.\n\nUnderneath all of this, the CRM integration is the backbone. We already have 12+ Salesforce API endpoints in production. This is not a generic loyalty layer - it is a domain-configured infrastructure product with the CRM and finance controls already built for enterprise deployment.",

          question:
            "Who is your target customer, and what does their ideal profile look like?",
          answer:
            "My primary target customer is a mid-to-large enterprise in one of three verticals: real estate development, banking and financial services (specifically NBFCs and private banks), or automotive dealer groups.\n\nThe ideal profile across all three:\n\nCompany size: Rs200Cr-Rs5,000Cr revenue. Large enough to have a CRM (typically Salesforce), a marketing or CRM team, and a budget for customer retention software. Small enough that they cannot build this in-house and cannot afford Capillary or Comarch pricing.\n\nCRM: Salesforce or a comparable enterprise CRM already in use. Our integrations are built on Salesforce - clients who are already on Salesforce have zero integration friction.\n\nCustomer base: 5,000-500,000 members. Below 5,000, loyalty ROI is marginal. Above 500,000, we need additional infrastructure (which is on the roadmap).\n\nGeography: India Tier 1-2 cities in Year 1. GCC expansion in Year 2.\n\nThe buyer: CMO or VP Marketing (owns the loyalty programme mandate), co-signed by the CFO (escrow wallet and liability management story) and Head of IT (Salesforce integration story). All three must be addressed - our sales motion runs three parallel tracks.\n\nThe user: CRM Manager or Loyalty Programme Manager. They configure rules, monitor performance, and manage the redemption catalogue. They are our champions because we eliminate their IT dependency for every rule change.\n\nMy beachhead is the real estate vertical - we have a live reference client, proven rules in production, and no meaningful competition. BFSI is the second priority (higher ACV, longer sales cycle). Automotive is third (high ROI story but OEM complexity adds friction).",

          answer:
            "My direct competitors are Capillary Technologies (India), Salesforce Loyalty Management (global enterprise), Antavo (global enterprise), and Xoxoday/Plum (India - voucher fulfilment, not a true loyalty platform).\n\nHere is how I think about each:\n\nCapillary: The incumbent India loyalty leader. Built for retail - deep POS integration, strong analytics, large client base. Cannot serve real estate, BFSI, or automotive without heavy customisation. Priced at Rs25L-2Cr+ for features I have built for Rs15-35L. My advantage: vertical depth, escrow wallet, and 60% lower price for non-retail clients.\n\nSalesforce Loyalty Management: Available only to companies on the full Salesforce stack, and priced at Rs30L-Rs3Cr+ annually. Requires a Salesforce consultant to configure rules - marketing teams cannot self-serve. My advantage: no-code rule engine, 8x faster deployment, vertical-specific rule templates, and escrow controls that Salesforce does not offer at any price.\n\nAntavo: The Gartner Leader for enterprise loyalty globally. EUR80,000-650,000+/year. No India presence, no escrow wallet, 9-18 month deployment cycles. My advantage: India pricing, India vertical knowledge, 8-12 week deployment, and the escrow wallet.\n\nXoxoday/Plum: The default 'loyalty tool' in India. It is not a loyalty platform - it is a reward fulfilment platform. No rule engine, no wallet, no tiers, no escrow. My strategy: position Xoxoday as our fulfilment partner, not our competitor. We are what sits above Xoxoday - the intelligence layer that decides who earns what and when.\n\nMy three defensible advantages:\n1. The only platform combining a 7-dimension no-code rule engine + escrow liability management + production-proven Salesforce integration - no competitor has all three.\n2. Vertical depth: 30+ rules in production for real estate - a competitor would need 12-18 months to replicate the domain knowledge embedded in our rule templates and integrations.\n3. India execution advantage: I can deploy in 8-12 weeks at one-third the cost of enterprise global players.",

          answer:
            "Year 1 is a direct sales and reference-led motion. I am not trying to build a PLG engine or a channel network in Year 1 - I am trying to close 8-10 enterprise clients and build the case study infrastructure that makes Month 13 onwards scalable.\n\nMy 12-month GTM in three tracks:\n\nTrack 1 - Real Estate (Months 1-6, primary focus):\nEntry point: collections TAT problem. Every discovery call leads with: 'What is your average days-to-payment after a demand note? We can reduce that by 35-45% with one rule.' This single data point justifies the ACV before any product demonstration. I am using our live reference client as the centrepiece - every prospect gets a 30-minute call with the reference client's CRM manager before signing.\n\nTrack 2 - BFSI (Months 3-9, parallel):\nEntry point: EMI on-time payment incentive + RBI compliance framing. The escrow wallet is the CFO and compliance unlock. I publish the RBI loyalty liability compliance guide in Month 1 - this gets me into compliance officer conversations that no standard sales motion reaches.\n\nTrack 3 - Automotive (Months 5-12, later start):\nEntry point: aftersales revenue retention - first-service capture rate is the metric. I approach FADA (Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations) for a knowledge partner role in Month 2. Speaking at one FADA event converts to 5-10 qualified meetings.\n\nAcross all three: I am building one Salesforce SI partner relationship per quarter. Each SI partner is worth 3-8 qualified referrals per year from their existing BFSI / real estate client base.\n\nYear 1 commercial target: Rs1.8-2.5Cr ARR from 7-10 signed clients. Year 1 operating goal: 2 reference clients with published, named case studies.",

            "What are the key risks, and how do you plan to manage them?",
          answer:
            "I see five material risks:\n\nRisk 1 - Long sales cycles create cash flow pressure.\nEnterprise B2B deals take 3-8 months to close. With a small team and one reference client, a 3-month pipeline drought could be existential.\nMitigation: The 90-day paid pilot (Rs3-5L) compresses the decision timeline. It also generates early cash and a data-rich case study simultaneously. I never pitch a full ACV before offering a pilot - it lowers the activation energy of every decision.\n\nRisk 2 - Single vertical concentration risk.\nIf real estate developers stop buying (regulatory change, market slowdown), we have no fallback revenue in Year 1.\nMitigation: BFSI track launches in parallel from Month 3. The product is genuinely vertical-agnostic - it is our sales focus that is vertical-specific. Diversification is built into the GTM plan, not an afterthought.\n\nRisk 3 - Capillary or Salesforce drops pricing to block mid-market penetration.\nBoth have the scale to price us out if they choose to.\nMitigation: Our moat is not price - it is vertical depth and the escrow wallet. Neither Capillary nor Salesforce can ship a demand-note rule trigger, a mark-to-market escrow wallet, and a production-proven Salesforce integration in less than 12-18 months. We use that window to sign 5-8 reference clients and build switching cost.\n\nRisk 4 - Key person dependency.\nIn a 4-person team, losing one technical co-founder or the sales lead would be material.\nMitigation: Document every integration, every rule template, and every client configuration in the onboarding playbook from Day 1. The business should not live in anyone's head. Vesting cliffs and ESOP structures are in place.\n\nRisk 5 - Regulatory change in BFSI loyalty (RBI guideline tightening).\nRBI has issued guidance on prepaid instruments that could affect how loyalty points are classified.\nMitigation: The escrow wallet is our hedge - it is designed to be RBI-compatible. I publish the compliance guide and engage with FIDC/MFIN to stay ahead of regulatory development. Being the 'compliant loyalty platform' is a feature, not a burden.",

This is a product that handles real money and real customer data for a major enterprise client.\n\nCapability gaps and hiring plan:\n\nMonth 2 - Senior Sales Hire (Priority: Critical):\nSomeone who has sold enterprise B2B SaaS into real estate or BFSI in India. They must be able to navigate a buying committee (CMO, CFO, IT) and close deals at Rs20-40L ACV independently. This hire frees the founding team from sales calls and allows us to pursue three verticals simultaneously.\n\nMonth 4 - Customer Success Manager (Priority: High):\nAs we onboard clients 2 and 3, the founding team cannot be the onboarding resource. The CS Manager owns onboarding time reduction and client health metrics. They run the playbook, configure the first rule set with the client, and track MAU and redemption rates month-on-month.\n\nMonth 6 - Marketing / Content Hire (Priority: Medium):\nTo sustain LinkedIn content velocity and manage event logistics. The founding team's time is better spent in sales and product at this stage - but the content engine must not stop.\n\nMonth 10-12 - ML Engineer (Priority: Medium):\nTo begin building the AI reward optimisation engine. This is the 6-18 month roadmap item - hiring ahead of it allows a 3-4 month research and prototyping phase before production.\n\nAdvisory board: I am building a 3-person advisory board: (1) a former CXO at a large Indian real estate developer who can open doors and validate the product, (2) a BFSI compliance expert who can advise on RBI loyalty guidelines, and (3) a Salesforce ecosystem leader who can accelerate partner relationships.",

            "In 5 years, I want to be the default loyalty infrastructure for high-value customer relationships in emerging markets - starting in India, expanding to GCC and SEA.\n\nThe 5-year vision has three layers:\n\nLayer 1 - Category ownership in India (Years 1-3):\nWe become the obvious answer when a CFO at an Indian real estate developer, NBFC, or automotive group asks 'how do we build a loyalty programme?' Not because we outspent Capillary on marketing - but because we have the deepest vertical knowledge, the most specific product, and the most published proof points in each category. 40+ clients in India across 5 verticals, Rs15-25Cr ARR.\n\nLayer 2 - GCC expansion (Years 3-4):\nThe GCC (UAE, Saudi, Qatar, Bahrain) has identical verticals to India - real estate groups, Islamic banks, automotive dealerships - and a far higher willingness to pay for loyalty infrastructure. A single UAE real estate group deployment at Rs200,000 ACV equals 5 Indian clients. We expand with a small regional sales presence and a data residency-compliant infrastructure. Rs40-70Cr ARR.\n\nLayer 3 - Platform and ecosystem (Years 4-5):\nWe open our API to third-party developers and Salesforce ISV partners. The Loyalty Rule Engine becomes an infrastructure layer - not just a product. ISVs build vertical-specific extensions on top of us. We take a platform fee. This is the Stripe/Twilio model for loyalty - infrastructure that others build on. Rs100Cr+ ARR with 60%+ gross margins.\n\nWhat success looks like to me in 5 years:\n- 80-120 enterprise clients across India and GCC\n- Rs80-120Cr ARR with 70%+ gross margin\n- NRR of 120%+ - clients expanding, not churning\n- The escrow wallet is an industry standard - other platforms copy it\n- One IPO-ready balance sheet or a strategic acquisition by a global loyalty or CRM player at 8-12x revenue\n\nThe north star has not changed: every client's customers should feel genuinely rewarded for the behaviours that matter most to the business - and every client's CFO should sleep soundly knowing exactly what their loyalty liability is. If we achieve both at scale, we have built something worth building.",
