No competitor offers this without an enterprise contract. This directly addresses RBI/SEBI data localisation requirements in India and PDPL/NDMO regulations in the GCC.\n\nUSP 2 ,MS Office document creation and export (for IT heads replacing MS 365, ops and finance teams): Teams can create Word documents, Excel sheets, PowerPoint presentations, and PDFs inside PTM and export them as official Microsoft Office files. No other PM tool in our price range does this. We replace a ₹750+/user/month MS 365 subscription for document creation.\n\nUSP 3 ,MoM-to-task auto-conversion (for project managers, ops leads, and consulting teams): Every meeting action item is automatically converted into an assigned task with a deadline and responsible person ,in one click. No more Word documents with action points nobody follows up on. No PM competitor has this as a native, structured workflow.\n\nUSP 4 ,Opportunity Register (for leadership and product teams): A public suggestion forum where any employee or external stakeholder can post ideas that are tagged, prioritised, and converted to tasks. No PM competitor has this built natively into the project management workflow. PTM becomes an innovation management layer.\n\nUSP 5 ,All-in-one consolidation at mid-market price (for cost-conscious COOs and founders): PTM replaces Jira/Asana + Slack + Google Docs + a MoM/notes tool ,typically 4 separate subscriptions ,with one platform at ₹599–799/user/month.

We will have built the first work management platform that also functions as the financial accountability layer for an organisation , where every task completed flows directly into payroll, and where every piece of company data lives permanently on infrastructure the company owns.\n\nThe transformation we are driving: organisations stop being tenants on vendor infrastructure and become owners of their own digital operations.",

Priority segments: Tech/SaaS companies (25 accounts), Real Estate developers (15 accounts), Professional Services firms (15 accounts). At least 5 GCC accounts to validate international pricing.\n\nGoal 3 , Product milestone: Ship mobile app (iOS + Android) by Month 3 and live demo environment by Month 2. These are the two highest-priority deal blockers in current pipeline.\n\nGoal 4 , Market entry: Establish PTM brand in the 'data sovereign work management' category in India. Target: 3 published case studies with named customers, 1 speaking slot at a relevant industry event (NASSCOM Product Conclave, TechSparks, or equivalent), 500+ LinkedIn followers on PTM product page.\n\nGoal 5 , Team: Hire 1 dedicated sales person (SDR or AE with PM software experience) by Month 4. Hire 1 customer success manager by Month 6 to manage onboarding and reduce early churn.",

          answer:
            "Segment 1 , Tech / SaaS companies, India metros (Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad, Mumbai), 50–300 employees:\nChosen because: highest urgency (Jira + Slack + Google Docs fragmentation is a daily pain they can articulate), fastest sales cycle (product-literate buyers self-evaluate quickly), and highest internal advocacy potential (engineering teams who adopt PTM drag the rest of the company in). Entry point: pitch to CTO or VP Engineering on the sovereignty + sprint consolidation story.\n\nSegment 2 , Professional Services (consulting, legal, audit), India metros + Dubai/Abu Dhabi, 20–150 professionals:\nChosen because: data sovereignty is a compliance obligation in this segment (DIFC-regulated entities in Dubai, SEBI-regulated advisors in India). High ACV (₹10–20L per account). MoM-to-task and document creation features are immediately compelling. Decision cycle is 4–8 weeks , manageable. Entry point: the 'your client data should not live on Google's servers' pitch to Managing Partner or Practice Head.\n\nSegment 3 , Locksted FM Matrix and Loyalty existing clients (cross-sell), all geographies:\nChosen because: zero CAC. Trust already established. PTM is a natural extension of the Locksted platform relationship. Positioning: 'You already use Locksted for FM and customer experience , now use it for the work management layer that connects your teams.' Fastest path to first 10–15 accounts with short sales cycles.",

            "What 3 key actions or projects will help achieve this year's goals?",
          answer:
            "Initiative 1 , Build a direct outbound sales motion targeting CTOs and VP Engineering at Tech/SaaS companies with 50–300 employees in Bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad.\nExecution: Founder-led for first 3 months. Build a list of 300 target companies from LinkedIn Sales Navigator. Outbound sequence: LinkedIn connection + personalised note on data sovereignty → 3-touch email sequence → phone call. Aim for 5 qualified demo calls per week. Message: 'your engineering team's sprint data, product roadmap, and client communications are on Atlassian's servers in the US , let's fix that.' Hire 1 SDR by Month 4 to take over outbound as founder moves to closing.\n\nInitiative 2 , Launch the 'Data Sovereign Work Management' category through a hosted roundtable series and LinkedIn content engine.\nExecution: Host 3 invite-only roundtables (40–60 attendees each) in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Dubai on the topic of data sovereignty in enterprise tools. Position PTM as the convener, not the pitch. Follow up every attendee with a personalised case for PTM within 48 hours. Simultaneously, publish 2 pieces of long-form content per month on LinkedIn (Founder account + PTM company page) on topics: data localisation regulations, SaaS data risk, tool consolidation ROI. Goal: 10 inbound demo requests per month by Month 6.\n\nInitiative 3 , Execute a zero-CAC cross-sell campaign through Locksted's existing FM Matrix and Loyalty client base.\nExecution: Map all current Locksted clients with 50+ employees who do not yet use PTM. Build a personalised outreach sequence for each account manager relationship. Offer existing clients a 90-day free trial of PTM with dedicated onboarding. Target: 15 converted accounts from existing client base by Month 6. Case studies from these accounts become the proof-of-concept material for new segment outbound.",

          question: "What are the key numbers or metrics to track regularly?",
          answer:
            "COMMERCIAL KPIs:\n1. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and MRR growth rate (%) month-on-month , primary health metric\n2. New logo count per month , number of new paying companies (not seats)\n3. Average Contract Value (ACV), target ₹8–12L for mid-market accounts; track separately for India vs GCC\n4. Sales cycle length , days from first demo to signed contract; target under 45 days for SMB, 60–90 for mid-market\n5. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) , total sales + marketing spend ÷ new logos. Target CAC payback under 12 months\n6. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) , if existing customers expand (add seats), NRR > 100% means growth even without new logos\n\nPRODUCT KPIs:\n1. Week-1 activation rate , % of new accounts that complete their first full project setup (project + milestone + 3 tasks + 1 MoM) within 7 days of signup. Target: 60%+\n2. Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU ratio) , measures habit formation. Target: 40%+ ratio (40 daily users for every 100 monthly users)\n3. Feature adoption by module , % of accounts using each core module (kanban, MoM, wallet, docs). Flags which features drive retention vs which are underused\n4. Time-to-value , how many days from account creation to first completed milestone. Target: under 14 days\n5. Support ticket volume per account , leading indicator of onboarding friction or UX gaps. Spike = intervention needed\n6. NPS / CSAT , quarterly pulse. Target NPS 40+ in Year 1. Below 30 = product-market fit is not solid yet",

          question:
            "What improvements do you need in your people or processes to succeed?",
          answer:
            "Gap 1 , Mobile app engineering capability: We do not have a mobile app. Every deal involving field teams, real estate site managers, or CXOs who check status on their phones is currently at risk. We need to either hire 1–2 mobile engineers (React Native or Flutter) or engage a specialist mobile development partner in the next 60 days. This is the single highest-priority people/capability gap.\n\nGap 2 , Sales function (first hire): Currently running on founder-led sales, which caps how many deals can run in parallel. By Month 4, we need a first sales hire , ideally an SDR with SaaS PM software experience who can run outbound sequences and qualify inbound leads, freeing the founder for closing and strategy. Without this, growth above ₹50L ARR is bottlenecked.\n\nGap 3 , Customer success and onboarding: We have no formal onboarding process. Activation rates will suffer without a structured 30-day onboarding playbook and a dedicated person (even part-time initially) to walk new accounts through their first project, first MoM, and first MoM-to-task conversion. A single Customer Success hire by Month 6 can protect the first 50 accounts from churn.\n\nGap 4 , Integration engineering: The roadmap requires calendar integration (Month 1–3), GitHub/GitLab sync (Month 3–6), and HRMS connections (Month 6+). These are not trivial builds. We need a dedicated integrations engineer or a structured partnership with an SI who can build and maintain these integrations. Without integrations, enterprise accounts are out of reach.\n\nGap 5 , Brand and content function: Data sovereignty is a positioning story that needs to be told consistently , on LinkedIn, at events, in sales decks, in case studies. Currently there is no content or brand function. A part-time content marketer or a founder-facing ghostwriting arrangement is needed in Month 3–4 to maintain visibility.",
