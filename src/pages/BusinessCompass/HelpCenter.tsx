        question: "What is a KPI and how do I track it?",
        answer:
          "A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a measurable target tied to your role or team. Track it by updating values and notes on the cadence your admin defines — often weekly. Colors (green, yellow, red) usually reflect on-track, at-risk, and off-track status.",

        question: "What should I prepare for weekly meetings?",

      {
        question: "What are the different badge levels?",
